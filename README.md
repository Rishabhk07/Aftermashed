# AfterMashed
A website where you can "Like" or "Dislike" any event happening in Colleges.
website is live at - [aftermashed.com](http://aftermashed.com)

## Motivation
We attend many events in any College, 
workshops organised by different College Hubs but we never get to express how it went weather people "Liked" or "Disliked" these events(anonymously).Hence to fill this gap [AfterMashed](aftermashed.com) was born
